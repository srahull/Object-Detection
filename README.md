## References: 
Everything I implemented here has come from a course called Convolutional Neural Network on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng. 

The ideas presented here came primarily from the two YOLO papers. The implementation here also took significant inspiration and used many components from Allan Zelener's GitHub repository. The pre-trained weights used in this exercise came from the official YOLO website.
