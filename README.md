## Object Detection

Everything I implemented here has come from a course called Convolutional Neural Network on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng. 

## References: 
The ideas presented here came primarily from the two YOLO papers. The implementation here also took significant inspiration and used many components from Allan Zelener's GitHub repository. The pre-trained weights used in this exercise came from the official YOLO website.
